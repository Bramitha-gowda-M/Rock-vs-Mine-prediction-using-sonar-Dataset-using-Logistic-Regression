# Mine vs Rock Classification using Logistic Regression

This repository contains an implementation of a machine learning model using the Logistic Regression algorithm to classify mines vs rocks dataset. The dataset is a classic example in the field of machine learning used for binary classification tasks.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project consists of features obtained from sonar signals bounced off a metal cylinder and a roughly cylindrical rock. It includes 208 samples, with each sample containing 60 features.

## Implementation
The `Rock vs Mine prediction jupyter notebook.ipynb` notebook contains the Python code for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation. The model is trained on the dataset to distinguish between mines and rocks based on the input features.

## Dependencies
- Python 3
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn

## Usage
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <[repository_url](https://github.com/Bramitha-gowda-M/Rock-vs-Mine-prediction-using-sonar-Dataset-using-Logistic-Regression)https://github.com/Bramitha-gowda-M/Rock-vs-Mine-prediction-using-sonar-Dataset-using-Logistic-Regression>

## Open and run the logistic_regression_classification.ipynb notebook in Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab.

# Follow the instructions and execute the cells to preprocess the data, train the logistic regression model, and evaluate its performance.

# Feel free to explore, modify, and experiment with the code to learn more about machine learning and logistic regression classification!
